# KnowledgeNotes
A good start is all you need!

---
The repository aims to create an AI-related research station that provides the basic knowledge and wish it can give you a good start in your research story.


:smiley: Why join the organization and make a contribution? 
1.  You can have a chance to share anything during your research and build an excellent community with other researchers!
2.  You can get familiar with the work pipeline in a large organization. Including the use of GitHub, and the way of communication with others to write better content!
3.  You can get valuable experiences from others, including research, coding, and writing skills. And maybe your next idea is to come from them.
4.  Each commit or PR can give you a sense of achievement and the feeling of everyone is working together can support you to go far and steady.

:satisfied: What you can share?
Basically, you can share the contents that belong to any categories.  More specifically, you can share content including but not limited to the following:
1. You encountered a problem and how you solved it.
2. Some experiences in Research, Coding, Writing, or Presentation.
3. Some interesting things, not necessarily research-related things, you can share to ShareAnything.

Overall, what you share should be true and well organized. If you have something that you want others to share, you can submit an issue.
